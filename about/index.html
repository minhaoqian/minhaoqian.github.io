      <p>
        I am an undergraduate student in Statistics, Economics and Finance at University College London,
        with a forthcoming MSc in Mathematical and Computational Finance at the University of Oxford.
        My academic interests lie in quantitative finance, data-driven decision making, and financial modeling.
      </p>

      <p>
        My coursework has provided a strong foundation in probability, statistics, econometrics, and programming,
        with a focus on applying quantitative methods to real-world financial problems.
        I am particularly interested in the intersection of mathematics, computation, and financial markets.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside academics, I have a long-standing interest in football, which has shaped my appreciation
        for teamwork, strategy, and consistency.
